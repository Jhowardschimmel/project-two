30960,Overture #24,Jeff Demetriou,1,-84.3916383333333,33.7609716666667,"Complete in 2012, Overture #24 wraps around a full block. 

From the plaque: ""An overture is defined as an introductory event, action, or composition that precedes the more important or principal matter to follow. Similarly, this mural is part of a continuing series of 'Overture' works that are intended to be an introduction of sorts to a different way of perceiving our role and impact upon the world around us.""

The series deals primarily with concepts surrounding the idea of nature as being a single sentient entity that possess the ability to have both imaginative and abstract reflections on its own 'reality', as well as simultaneously having the ability to be completely analytical and empirically evaluative; attributes that are inherently contradictory to nature itself.

In many respects, the series functions as a mirror, reflecting viewers' own fears, dreams, conditioning, ideals, etc. back at them. The varied interpretations and experiences of the work that follow speak more so about viewers’ interaction with the work, as well as the headspace they're in, rather than the work itself...which is entirely intended and welcomed."
